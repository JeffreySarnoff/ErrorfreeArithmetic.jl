*While these are not strictly error-free transformations, they are very nearly so.*    
*They are as accurate as possible given the working precision.*

## introduction

Error-free transformations return a tuple of the nominal result and the residual from the result (the left-over part).    

Error-free addition sums two floating point values (x, y) and returns two floating point values (hi, lo) such that:    
* (+)(x, y) == hi  and  (+)(hi, lo) == hi where |hi| > |lo|


## use

This package is intended to be used in the support of other work.    
All routines expect Float64 or Float32 or Float16 values.
