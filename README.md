*This is likely an error-free transformation, though I have not seen a proof.*    
inv_errorfree 

*While these are not strictly error-free transformations, they are very nearly so.*    
*They are as accurate as possible given the working precision.*

sqrt_accurately, invsqrt_accurately    

## introduction

Error-free transformations return a tuple of the nominal result and the residual from the result (the left-over part).    

This package is intended to be used in the support of other work.
