## introduction

Error-free transformations return a tuple of the nominal result and the residual from the result (the left-over part).    

Error-free addition sums two floating point values (a, b) and returns two floating point values (hi, lo) such that:    
* `(+)(a, b) == hi` 
* `|hi| > |lo|` and `(+)(hi, lo) == hi`  *abs(hi) and abs(lo) do not share significant bits*

Here is how it is done:

```julia
function add_errorfree(a::T, b::T) where T<:Union{Float64, Float32}
    a_plus_b_hipart = a + b
    b_asthe_summand = a_plus_b_hipart - a
    a_plus_b_lopart = (a - (a_plus_b_hipart - b_asthe_summand)) + (b - b_asthe_summand)
    return a_plus_b_hipart, a_plus_b_lopart
end

a = Float32(1/golden^2)                         #   0.3819_6602f0
b = Float32(pi^3)                               #  31.0062_7700f0
a_plus_b = a + b                                #  31.3882_4300f0

hi, lo = add_errorfree(a,b)                     # (31.3882_4300f0, 3.8743_0270f-7)

a_plus_b == hi                                  # true
abs(hi) > abs(lo) && hi + lo == hi              # true

```
The `lo` part is a portion of the accurate value, it is (most of) the residuum that the `hi` part could not represent.    
The `hi` part runs out of significant bits before the all of the accurate value is represented.  We can see this:        
```julia
a = Float32(1/golden^2)                         #   0.3819_6602f0
b = Float32(pi^3)                               #  31.0062_7700f0

hi, lo = add_errorfree(a,b)                     # (31.3882_4300f0, 3.8743_0270f-7)

a_plus_b_accurate = BigFloat(a) + BigFloat(b)
lo_accurate  = Float32(a_plus_b_accurate - hi)

lo == lo_accurate                                # true
```

## use

This package is intended to be used in the support of other work.    
All routines expect Float64 or Float32 or Float16 values.
