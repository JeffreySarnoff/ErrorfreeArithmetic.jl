## exports

* these are errorfree transformations    
add_errorfree, subtract_errorfree,   
add_inorder_errorfree, subtract_inorder_errorfree,    
square_errorfree,  multiply_errorfree,    
inv_errorfree, fma_errorfree, fms_errorfree    

* while these are not strictly errorfree transformations, they are very nearly so and as accurate as possible given the work  
cube_accurately, divide_accurately,    
sqrt_accurately, invsqrt_accurately    

## introduction

Errorfree transformations return a tuple of the nominal result and the residual from the result (the left-over part).
